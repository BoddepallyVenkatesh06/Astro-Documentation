> Missing width and height attributes for `IMAGE_URL`. When using remote images, both dimensions are always required in order to avoid cumulative layout shift (CLS).

## What went wrong?
For remote images, `width` and `height` cannot be inferred from the original file. As such, in order to avoid CLS, those two properties are always required.

If your image is inside your `src` folder, you probably meant to import it instead. See [the Imports guide for more information](/en/guides/imports/#other-assets).
