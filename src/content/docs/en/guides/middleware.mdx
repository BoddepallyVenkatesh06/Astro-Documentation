**Middleware** allows you to intercept requests and responses and inject behaviors dynamically every time a page or endpoint is about to be rendered. 

This also allows you to set and share request-specific information across endpoints and pages by mutating a `locals` object that is available in all Astro components and API endpoints

Middleware is available in both SSG and SSR Astro projects.

## Basic Usage

1. Create `src/middleware.js|ts` (Alternatively, you can create `src/middleware/index.js|ts`.)

2. Inside this file, export an [`onRequest()`](/en/reference/api-reference/#onrequest) function that can be passed a [`context` object](#the-context-object) and `next()` function. This must not be a default export.

    ```js title="src/middleware.js"
    export function onRequest ({ locals, request }, next) {
        // intercept data from a request
        // optionally, modify the properties in `locals`
        locals.title = "New title";

        // return a Response or the result of calling `next()`
        return next();
    };
    ```

3. Inside any `.astro` file, access response data using `Astro.locals`.

    ```astro title="src/components/Component.astro"
    ---
    const data = Astro.locals;
    ---
    <h1>{data.title}</h1>
    <p>This {data.property} is from middleware.</p>
    ```

### The `context` object

The [`context`](/en/reference/api-reference/#endpoint-context) object includes information to be made available to other middleware, API routes and `.astro` routes during the rendering process.

This is an optional argument passed to `onRequest()` that may contain the `locals` object as well as any additional properties to be shared during rendering. For example, the `context` object may include cookies used in authentication.

### Storing data in `context.locals`

`context.locals` is an object that can be manipulated inside the middleware.

This `locals` object is forwarded across the request handling process and is available as a property to [`APIContext`](/en/reference/api-reference/#contextlocals) and [`AstroGlobal`](/en/reference/api-reference/#astrolocals). This allows data to be shared between middlewares, API routes, and `.astro` pages. This is useful for storing request-specific data, such as user data, across the rendering step.

:::tip[Integration properties]
[Integrations](/en/guides/integrations-guide/) may set properties and provide functionality through the `locals` object. If you are using an integration, check its documentation to ensure you are not overriding any of its properties or doing unnecessary work.
:::

You can store any type of data inside `locals`: strings, numbers, and even complex data types such as functions and maps.

```js title="src/middleware.js"
export function onRequest ({ locals, request }, next) {
    // intercept data from a request
    // optionally, modify the properties in `locals`
    locals.user.name = "John Wick";
    locals.welcomeTitle = () => {
        return "Welcome back " + locals.user.name;
    };

    // return a Response or the result of calling `next()`
    return next();
};
```

Then you can use this information inside any `.astro` file with `Astro.locals`.

```astro title="src/pages/orders.astro"
---
const title = Astro.locals.welcomeTitle();
const orders = Array.from(Astro.locals.orders.entries());
---
<h1>{title}</h1>
<p>This {data.property} is from middleware.</p>
<ul>
    {orders.map(order => {
        return <li>{/* do something with each order */}</li>;
    })}
</ul>
```

`locals` is an object that lives and dies within a single Astro route; when your route page is rendered, `locals` won't exist anymore and a new one will be created. Information that needs to persist across multiple page requests must be stored elsewhere.

:::note
The value of `locals` cannot be overridden at run time. Doing so would risk wiping out all the information stored by the user.  In `dev` mode, Astro performs checks and will throw an error if `locals` are overridden.
:::

## Example: redacting sensitive information

The example below uses middleware to replace "PRIVATE INFO" with the word "REDACTED" to allow you to render modified HTML on your page:

```js title="src/middleware.js"
export const onRequest = async (context, next) => {
    const response = await next();
    const html = await response.text();
    const redactedHtml = html.replaceAll("PRIVATE INFO", "REDACTED");
    
    return new Response(redactedHtml, {
        status: 200,
        headers: response.headers
    });
};
```

## Middleware types

You can import and use the utility function `defineMiddleware()` to take advantage of type safety:

```ts
// src/middleware.ts
import { defineMiddleware } from "astro:middleware";

// `context` and `next` are automatically typed
export const onRequest = defineMiddleware((context, next) => {

});
```

Instead, if you're using JsDoc to take advantage of type safety, you can use `MiddlewareResponseHandler`:

```js
// src/middleware.js
/**
 * @type {import("astro").MiddlewareResponseHandler}
 */
// `context` and `next` are automatically typed
export const onRequest = (context, next) => {

};
```

To type the information inside `Astro.locals`, which gives you autocompletion inside `.astro` files and middleware code, declare a global namespace in the `env.d.ts` file:

```ts title="src/env.d.ts"
/// <reference types="astro/client" />
declare namespace App {
    interface Locals {
        user: {
            name: string
        },
        welcomeTitle: () => string,
        orders: Map<string, object>
    }
}
```

Then, inside the middleware file, you can take advantage of autocompletion and type safety.

## Chaining middleware

Multiple middlewares can be joined in a specified order using [`sequence()`](/en/reference/api-reference/#sequence):

```js title="src/middleware.js"
import { sequence } from "astro:middleware";

async function validation(_, next) {
    console.log("validation request");
    const response = await next();
    console.log("validation response");
    return response;
}

async function auth(_, next) {
    console.log("auth request");
    const response = await next();
    console.log("auth response");
    return response;
}

async function greeting(_, next) {
    console.log("greeting request");
    const response = await next();
    console.log("greeting response");
    return response;
}

export const onRequest = sequence(validation, auth, greeting);
```

This will result in the following console order:

```sh
validation request
auth request
greeting request
greeting response
auth response
validation response
```
