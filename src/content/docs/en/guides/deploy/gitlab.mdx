You can use [GitLab Pages](https://pages.gitlab.io/) to host an Astro site for your [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) projects, groups, or user account.

:::tip[Looking for an example?]
Check out [the official GitLab Pages Astro example project](https://gitlab.com/pages/astro)!
:::

## How to deploy

1. Set the correct `site` in `astro.config.mjs`.
2. Rename the `public/` directory to `static`.
3. Set `outDir:public` in `astro.config.mjs`. This setting instructs Astro to put the static build output in a folder called `public`, which is the folder required by GitLab Pages for exposed files.

   If you were using the [`public/` directory](/en/core-concepts/project-structure/#public) as a source of static files in your Astro project, rename it and use that new folder name in `astro.config.mjs` for the value of `publicDir`.

   For example, here are the correct `astro.config.mjs` settings when the `public/` directory is renamed to `static/`:

   ```js
   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
   
   export default defineConfig({
     site: 'https://<user>.gitlab.io',
     base: '/<project-name>',
     outDir: 'public',
     publicDir: 'static',
   });
   ```

4. Create a file called `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the root of your project with the content below. This will build and deploy your site whenever you make changes to your content:

   ```yaml
   pages:
     # The Docker image that will be used to build your app
     image: node:lts

     before_script:
       - npm ci

     script:
       # Specify the steps involved to build your app here
       - npm run build

     artifacts:
       paths:
         # The folder that contains the built files to be published.
         # This must be called "public".
         - public

     only:
       # Trigger a new build and deploy only when there is a push to the
       # branch(es) below
       - main
   ```
