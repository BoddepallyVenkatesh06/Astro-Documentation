You can use [Vercel](http://vercel.com/) to deploy an Astro site to their global edge network with zero configuration.

This guide includes instructions for deploying to Vercel through the website UI or Vercel's CLI.

## Project Configuration

Your Astro project can be deployed to Vercel as a static site, or as a server-side rendered site (SSR).

### Static Site

Your Astro project is a static site by default. You don‚Äôt need any extra configuration to deploy a static Astro site to Vercel. 

### Adapter for SSR

To enable SSR in your Astro project and deploy on Vercel:

Add [the Vercel adapter](/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/) to enable SSR in your Astro project with the following `astro add` command. This will install the adapter and make the appropriate changes to your `astro.config.mjs` file in one step.

```bash
npx astro add vercel
```

If you prefer to install the adapter manually instead, complete the following two steps:

1. Install [the `@astrojs/vercel` adapter](/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/) to your project‚Äôs dependencies using your preferred package manager. If you‚Äôre using npm or aren‚Äôt sure, run this in the terminal:

    ```bash
      npm install @astrojs/vercel
    ```

1. Add two new lines to your `astro.config.mjs` project configuration file.

    ```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={2, 5-6}
    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
    import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/serverless';

    export default defineConfig({
      output: 'server',
      adapter: vercel(),
    });
    ```

## How to deploy

You can deploy to Vercel through the website UI or using Vercel‚Äôs CLI (command line interface). The process is the same for both static and SSR Astro sites.

### Website UI Deployment

1. Push your code to your online Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
2. [Import your project](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel.
3. Vercel will automatically detect Astro and configure the right settings.
4. Your application is deployed! (e.g. [astro.vercel.app](https://astro.vercel.app/))

After your project has been imported and deployed, all subsequent pushes to branches will generate [Preview Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/preview-deployments), and all changes made to the Production Branch (commonly ‚Äúmain‚Äù) will result in a [Production Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/environments#production).

### CLI Deployment

1. Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) and run `vercel` to deploy.

    ```bash
    npm install -g vercel
    vercel
    ```

2. Vercel will automatically detect Astro and configure the right settings.
3. When asked `Want to override the settings? [y/N]`, choose `N`.
4. Your application is deployed! (e.g. [astro.vercel.app](https://astro.vercel.app/))


### Project config with vercel.json

You can use `vercel.json` to override the default behavior of Vercel and to configure additional settings. For example, you may wish to attach headers to HTTP responses from your Deployments.

### Upgrading to Astro 2.0

Astro v2.0 drops support for Node 14, so make sure your project is using **Node `18.14.1` or later**. You can [define the Node.js version](https://vercel.com/changelog/node-js-version-now-customizable-in-the-project-settings) used during the Build Step and Serverless Functions from the General page under Project Settings.
