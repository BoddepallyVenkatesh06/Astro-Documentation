This **[Astro integration][astro-integration]** enables server-side rendering and client-side hydration for your [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) components.

## Installation

There are two ways to add integrations to your project. Let's try the most convenient option first!

### `astro add` command

Astro includes a CLI tool for adding first party integrations: `astro add`. This command will:

1.  (Optionally) Install all necessary dependencies and peer dependencies
2.  (Also optionally) Update your `astro.config.*` file to apply this integration

To install `@astrojs/solid-js`, run the following from your project directory and follow the prompts:

```sh
# Using NPM
npx astro add solid
# Using Yarn
yarn astro add solid
# Using PNPM
pnpm astro add solid
```

If you run into any issues, [feel free to report them to us on GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues) and try the manual installation steps below.

### Install dependencies manually

First, install the `@astrojs/solid-js` integration like so:

```sh
npm install @astrojs/solid-js
```

Most package managers will install associated peer dependencies as well. Still, if you see a "Cannot find package 'solid-js'" (or similar) warning when you start up Astro, you'll need to install SolidJS:

```sh
npm install solid-js
```

Now, apply this integration to your `astro.config.*` file using the `integrations` property:

```diff lang="js" "solid()"
  // astro.config.mjs
  import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
+ import solid from '@astrojs/solid-js';

  export default defineConfig({
    // ...
    integrations: [solid()],
    //             ^^^^^^^
  });
```

## Getting started

To use your first SolidJS component in Astro, head to our [UI framework documentation][astro-ui-frameworks]. You'll explore:

*   üì¶ how framework components are loaded,
*   üíß client-side hydration options, and
*   ü§ù opportunities to mix and nest frameworks together

## Options

### Combining multiple JSX frameworks

When you are using multiple JSX frameworks (React, Preact, Solid) in the same project, Astro needs to determine which JSX framework-specific transformations should be used for each of your components. If you have only added one JSX framework integration to your project, no extra configuration is needed.

Use the `include` (required) and `exclude` (optional) configuration options to specify which files belong to which framework. Provide an array of files and/or folders to `include` for each framework you are using. Wildcards may be used to include multiple file paths.

We recommend placing common framework components in the same folder (e.g. `/components/react/` and `/components/solid/`) to make specifying your includes easier, but this is not required:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import preact from '@astrojs/preact';
import react from '@astrojs/react';
import svelte from '@astrojs/svelte';
import vue from '@astrojs/vue';
import solid from '@astrojs/solid-js';

export default defineConfig({
  // Enable many frameworks to support all different kinds of components.
  // No `include` is needed if you are only using a single JSX framework!
  integrations: [
    preact({
      include: ['**/preact/*'],
    }),
    react({
      include: ['**/react/*'],
    }),
    solid({
      include: ['**/solid/*'],
    }),
  ],
});
```
